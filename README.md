                    Checkers Basics
                    Objective: The goal of the game is to capture all of your opponent's pieces or block them so they cannot move.
                    
                    Setting Up the Game
                    Board Layout:
                    
                    Checkers is played on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares.
                    Each player starts with 12 pieces on the dark squares of the three rows closest to them.
                    Pieces:
                    
                    One player uses dark pieces, while the other uses light pieces.
                    Rules of the Game
                    Moving Pieces:
                    
                    Players take turns moving one piece at a time.
                    Regular pieces move diagonally forward to an adjacent dark square.
                    Capturing Opponent's Pieces:
                    
                    If an opponent's piece is on an adjacent square, and there’s an empty square immediately beyond it, you can "jump" over the opponent's piece, capturing it.
                    The captured piece is removed from the board.
                    If a jump is possible, you must make it. If multiple jumps are available, you can choose the sequence of jumps.
                    Becoming a King:
                    
                    When a piece reaches the last row on the opponent's side, it is "kinged" and receives a crown (usually represented by stacking another piece on top).
                    Kings can move diagonally both forward and backward.
                    Winning the Game:
                    
                    You win by capturing all of your opponent’s pieces or blocking them so they have no legal moves left.
                    Basic Strategy Tips
                    Control the Center: Try to control the central squares, which gives you more movement options.
                    Advance Together: Keep your pieces close together for support and protection.
                    Plan Ahead: Think about your moves and try to anticipate your opponent's responses.
                    Playing the Game
                    Decide who goes first (typically, the player with the dark pieces).
                    Take turns moving your pieces according to the rules above.
                    Continue until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
